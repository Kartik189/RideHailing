# RideHailing
A project that resembles the service provided by Ola/Uber, though it is completely done in C++ using the most basic OOP's concepts.
The purpose of this project was to sharpen and strengthen my understanding of basics of programming.

There are overall two basic classes that layout the structure of the project :
1. Driver class : That helps to deal with the data of drivers.
2. Customer/Passenger : That helps to deal with data of passengers.
